* Korean, English 
* **keywords:** Computational Design, Data, How to code for designers, Design algorithm, Computational Thinking ...  
* **These keywords** could help traditional designers to start thinking like computational design specialists. Computational thinking in design asks you holistic approaches to resolve a small design problem while also asking you an extremely isolated process to fix a comprehensive design concern. These different policies and thinking levels become huddles to understand computational design processes for designers.

Data's importance has led to the new age of design, making holistic design approaches in architectural, landscape, and urban design possible: Optimization, parametric design, data-driven design, and something fundamentally reliant on data. Therefore, the use of data in design is becoming much more significant than ever. Mainly, the change in our life by autonomous vehicles, IoT, block-chain, or smart cities based on 5G technology will accelerate the way of living and thinking, generating and consuming data daily. This lecture shows some snippets of How designers could surf with this new wave

* Korean, English
* **Keywords:** Data Structure, Graph, Matrix, Pixel, Voxel, Discretization, Partition, Connection, Search
* **Graph** is a mathematical object that consists of sets of points and edges dealing with discrete information. Graph is widely used for computation, discrete mathematics, or representing relational data structures. It has an explicit relationship among vertices by edges visualizing the topological aspect, such as a street network of urban, highway, or subway map, whose graphs closely resemble their physical form due to their characteristics. A graph is a useful tool for dealing with spatial information, including geometry in design process.

## New Material for Design

This article explores the growing role of data as a critical resource in modern design processes and its transformative impact across various design fields, including architecture, landscape, and urban design. It examines how data enables optimization, parametric design, and data-driven approaches, while also emphasizing the importance of software in processing and utilizing data. Additionally, it highlights the crucial role of visualization and interpretation in understanding and effectively communicating the meaning of data.

With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, data has emerged as an essential and inevitable material in modern industries, driven by advancements in computing power and infrastructure. Architectural design is no exception. Data provides a foundation for developing explicit and logical design processes, supporting informed decision-making throughout iterative design stages. As numerical representations of phenomena, environments, behaviors, and relationships, data plays a pivotal role in shaping design outcomes and driving innovation.

Both stochastic and deterministic approaches to data present opportunities to push the boundaries of design exploration. By leveraging data, designers can uncover new possibilities, optimize processes, and expand the potential of their creative work in unprecedented ways.

**Data** is becoming increasingly available not only for specialists but also for designers in diverse ways as a new materials in 21st century. The importance of data has led to the new age of design, and it made possible holistic design approaches in architectural, landscape, and urban design. Optimization, parametric design, data-driven design, and something fundamentally rely on data. The use of data in design is becoming much more significant than ever before. Mainly, the change of our life by autonomous vehicles, IoT, blockchain, or smart cities based on 5G technology will accelerate the way of living and thinking, generating and consuming data every single day.

**Software** is a way to package knowledge in a usable form or mobile or distributed structure. Software is not just a tool, but a bundle of knowledge of technique or method in action series to process data. The software contains lots of fundamental algorithms and logic that people have developed in the history of math, science, and architecture whenever you use a software or CAD program behind the scenes. The data is cooked based on recipes of the knowledge for the software. **The interface** is how to expose the knowledge to others as a set of sequences as a visual form on the screen where designers or users design their custom menus based on given recipes of the algorithms.

**CAD Technology** and interaction was quite mutual around early 2000. However, we have the emergency of new tools that are **Interactive** after that. Real-time graphics, interactive motion analysis and detection, Dynamic optimization system, and machine learning related applications will open the opportunity to explore manifold possibilities in design. As a form of software, the package of knowledge will deploy in different circumstances as they need and interact with the software.

Through the **Web Environment**, everything in the world has become interconnected. In our daily lives, we rely on web-based services for tasks such as sending emails, searching for information, checking the weather, and monitoring traffic. We also capture and share photos or videos through global platforms provided by companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Around the late 2000s, the software industry began transitioning its products, applications, and services from local environments to the web. The CAD industry was no exception to this trend. Today, mobile and browser-based applications serve as gateways to our virtual worlds, enabling communication, collaboration, and design creation—all of which generate data as their output.

**Visualization & Interpretation**, What is visualization? While the definition may vary across different domains, it can generally be understood as the process of translating computational results into a human-readable visual language, whether displayed on a screen or printed on paper. For instance, a simple math equation like 2 + 1 gives a result of three, which is universally understood without ambiguity—three is simply 3. However, real-world data is rarely so straightforward. Data represents numerical abstractions of facts, and its meaning often requires decoding and interpretation. This is because data does not inherently speak for itself; it gains significance only through the lens of context and analysis.

# Introduction to Computation for Design
* web: https://namjulee.github.io/njs-lab-public/work?id=2025-introductionToDesignComputation
* git: https://github.com/NamjuLee/data-in-design

**KEYWORD:**
* Vector, Raster, Urban Data, GIS, Data Processing, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Visualization, Mapping, Design Decision-Making ...

**SHORT DESCRIPTION:**
* This course contains several introductory lectures and hands-on workshops for those who want to use data as design materials to develop the design process. 

* We will gently visit the basic concepts and implementations of the topics: Code, Data and processing, Geometry data, Vector, Raster, and some machine learning models and their related technologies, such examples: Regression, Classification, Pattern, Data Representation, Dimensionality Reduction, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Implementation, Mapping, and Visualization Methodologies. 

* From the designer's perspective, students will better understand and implement the use of data and tools, finally, gain holistic high-level concepts to expand that knowledge and technology further. Therefore, the ideas and contents you will learn in this course could become a map for those who want to learn how to use data and digital media in design.

* Each day, students will learn the individual topics listed below. Then, students will make a group to discuss, help, understand, and finish homework and examples. All code and examples will be online, and the instructor will be available before and after class for troubleshooting.

* In addition, it is also possible for an individual or group to focus on one of the primary topics and revisit other topics after the course based on the student's ability and expectations. It is yours if you are interested in data as a design material.
